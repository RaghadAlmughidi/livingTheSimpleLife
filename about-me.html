            <p class="artical-body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. <br><br> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that
                I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <a href="#" class="title-paragraph"> How I turned things around </a>
            <p class="artical-body"><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. <br><br>It wasn't easy at all, but everything
                around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
            <a href="#" class="title-paragraph">Now I live the simple life</a>
            <p class="artical-body">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. <br> <br> With how much it turned my life around, <strong> I felt like I had no choice
                but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
